description: >
  The usage iterates over a data stream to encrypt all values fetched from it.
  During the iteration, the same `Cipher` instance is reused for the encryption
  tasks---which is fine---, but it is also reinitialized with each iteration.
  `Cipher` does not support reinitialization and, hence, this may lead to
  erroneous encryption.
