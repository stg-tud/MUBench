description: >
   On line 265, `StringTokenizer.nextToken()` is invoked without prior check of
   `hasMoreTokens()`. This usage may be safe from context, since the tokenized
   value is an RBG color value which has a known number of tokens. However, the
   usage is unsafe against invalid values and we, therefore, consider it a
   misuse.
