   In line 396, `StringTokenizer.nextToken()` is invoked repeatedly in a loop
   without prior check of whether there are sufficiently many tokens, e.g., via
   `hasNextToken()`. The enclosing method implements a lookup, which may be
   expected to throw if there is no matching element. However, this is not
   explicit.
