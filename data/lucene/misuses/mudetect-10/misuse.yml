description: >
  If `segmentsSource.size() == 0` in line 4718, then `end = 0` and the loop at
  line 4736 is skipped. Then `mergeDocStores` (line 4730) remains `false` and
  the branch accessing `segmentsSource.info(0)` at line 4790 is taken. Since
  `segmentsSource` is empty, this access causes an exception.
