  ObjectPersistenceManager.destroy() calls FileSystemResource.delete()
  (which delegates to FileSystem.deleteFile()) without checking FileSystemResource.fileExists()
  (which delegates to FileSytem.fileExists()). FileSystem.deleteFile() throws, if
  the file does not exist. A refactoring was performed in the course of the fix, to
  remove duplication.
