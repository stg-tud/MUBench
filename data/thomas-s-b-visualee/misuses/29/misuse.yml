  In line 256, `scanner.next()` is called without checking if there are more
  elements. Because the scanner is built from the `JavaSource` parameter,
  which may be invalid (e.g., package keyword followed by an empty package
  name), this may lead to a runtime exception without a useful error message.
fix:
  description: Add a check and report a meaningful error message.
